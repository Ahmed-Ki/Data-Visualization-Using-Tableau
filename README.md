## Project Description

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Choose a Dataset
- **Flight Delays and Cancellations**.
- US Census Demographic Data.
- Youtube Data from the US.

I Chose Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset and provided the csv files in the repo.

## Review Column Metadata
Some of the columns you want to use in your project will have coded values that represent longer more readable values. For instance the cancellation_reason column in the flights data set has the values: A, B, C, D These letters are not understandable by themselves. You need to replace these letters with the full reason to make your visualizations including this data more readable.

These letters correspond with the following reasons:

A - Airline/Carrier

B - Weather

C - National Air System

D - Security
